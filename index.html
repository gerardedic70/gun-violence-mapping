<center>  <h1> Death By Guns: Mapping the Gun Violence Epidemic in the US </h1>
  <h3> Data from the CDC shows which states had the highest death rates by firearms.
    When compared with an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety, it's revealed that states with highest firearm mortalities tend to have more lax gun laws.</h3>

    <p> The CDC’s data shows that gun violence is problematic throughout the United States. The issue, however, is more pronounced in certain states. </p>

    <p> Take Mississippi, as an example. It leads the nation with the highest averaged firearms death rate from 2016 to 2020 at 23.42 gun homicides per 100,000 residents. </p>

    <p> On the other end of the spectrum and looking at the same four-year timeframe, Massachusetts, leads the nation with the lowest averaged firearms death rate at 3.54 deaths per 100,000 residents. </p>

    <p> What’s to account for the differences? While factors contributing to gun violence are complex and varied, one gun violence advocacy group, Everytown for Gun Safety, believes a state’s gun laws largely affects how gun violence is played out in that state. </p>

    <p> Mississippi, Everytown notes, “has the weakest gun laws in the country,” lacking background checks for handgun purchases and a conceal carry permit. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is ranked by Everytown as fourth in the country for gun law strength, requiring background checks and conceal carry permits, among other requirements. </p>


    <p> While there are other factors at play that affect gun violence, such as a state’s gun ownership rate, Everytown argues that “states with strong laws see less gun violence.” </p>

    <p> Explore the map to see how other states fare in terms of their gun law strengths and death rates.
